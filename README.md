# React-Memory
##### A Memory Game created using React - Using Gundam Images...

React-Memory is a memory game created using React, it only differs slightly from other memory games in that the objective is to NOT click the same image twice.  Rather you want to make it through all 12 cards in the deck selecting a different one each time.  Once you're score reaches 12 you win the game and the game state rests, and if you select the same image twice, you lose and the game resets.

### Prerequisites

In order to install and run React-Memory on your own device you will need to have NodeJS and npm installed on your local device.

### Installing

You will need to do the following steps after cloning the repo to your device in order to ensure that it works properly.

To ensure Node.js is running within the package and configure all modules for use:
